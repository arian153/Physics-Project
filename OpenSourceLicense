DDS Loader

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// File: DDSTextureLoader.cpp
//
// Functions for loading a DDS texture and creating a Direct3D runtime resource for it
//
// Note these functions are useful as a light-weight runtime loader for DDS files. For
// a full-featured DDS file reader, writer, and texture processing pipeline see
// the 'Texconv' sample and the 'DirectXTex' library.

WIC Loader

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// File: WICTextureLoader.cpp
//
// Function for loading a WIC image and creating a Direct3D runtime texture for it
// (auto-generating mipmaps if possible)
//
// Note: Assumes application has already called CoInitializeEx
//
// Warning: CreateWICTexture* functions are not thread-safe if given a d3dContext instance for
//          auto-gen mipmap support.
//
// Note these functions are useful for images created as simple 2D textures. For
// more complex resources, DDSTextureLoader is an excellent light-weight runtime loader.
// For a full-featured DDS file reader, writer, and texture processing pipeline see
// the 'Texconv' sample and the 'DirectXTex' library.
